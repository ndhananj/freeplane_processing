# Freeplane Processing

This repository contains reference materials for working with the [Freeplane](https://www.freeplane.org/) mind‑mapping tool.
It catalogs the features available in a sample Freeplane map, explains how the application's XML format corresponds to visual
mind‑map elements, and collects research on effective mind‑mapping techniques.

## Repository contents

- **freeplane_keywords.md** – grouped, alphabetized inventory of every label found in the sample `freeplaneFunctions.mm` map.
- **freeplane_structure.md** – walkthrough of how specific XML snippets render into the visual elements shown in the map.
- **best-mind-maps.md** – summary of evidence‑based principles from learning science for creating effective mind maps.
